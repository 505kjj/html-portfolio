<h1>The Best Movies According to Khushi </h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

 <h3>How to lose a guy in 10 days</h3>
 <p>It’s the perfect blend of humor, charm, and emotional depth wrapped in a light-hearted story. It offers a fun take on modern dating, with two leads who are both trying to manipulate each other but end up genuinely falling in love. The movie is not only entertaining but also refreshingly witty, making it ideal for anyone looking for a feel-good film that doesn’t take itself too seriously yet still delivers on romance and heart. It’s great for a cozy evening, especially when you want to laugh and believe in love at the same time.</p>
 <h3>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h3>
 <p>It beautifully captures the feelings of being an outsider, the pain of past trauma, and the quiet strength in finding your people. Through the eyes of Charlie, a shy and sensitive teenager, we witness the complexity of growing up—dealing with mental health, grief, first love, and friendship. The characters are imperfect but real, and the story reminds us that even in our darkest moments, we’re not alone. It’s a film that comforts, challenges, and stays with you, making it perfect for anyone navigating change or looking for something that truly understands what it's like to feel different yet still hope for more.</p>
 <h3>The Notebook</h3>
 <p>It beautifully portrays a love story that transcends time, hardship, and even memory. The film explores the power of true connection — how two people from different worlds can fall deeply in love, drift apart, and still find their way back to each other. What makes it special isn’t just the romance between Noah and Allie, but the way the story is told — through an older man's narration, reading their shared past aloud to his wife who no longer remembers him. It’s tender, emotional, and heart-wrenching in the best way, reminding us that love, when real, can weather anything. Perfect for anyone craving a story that’s equal parts passion, nostalgia, and emotional depth.</p>
